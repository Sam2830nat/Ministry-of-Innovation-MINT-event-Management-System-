## Overview

**MInT EMS** is a comprehensive, full-stack Ministry Event Management System built for Addis Ababa Science and Technology University. It replaces fragmented, manual event workflows with a centralized digital platform that serves Guests, Event Organizers, and Administrators.

The system is composed of three main applications:

| App | Technology | Purpose |
|:----|:-----------|:--------|
| **`apps/api`** | NestJS 11 + Prisma 7 | RESTful API, WebSocket gateway, business logic |
| **`apps/web`** | Next.js 14 (App Router) + Shadcn UI | Primary web dashboard and guest portal |
| **`apps/ml-service`** | FastAPI + scikit-surprise | Hybrid ML recommendation engine |

All services are orchestrated via **Docker Compose** and sit behind an **Nginx** reverse proxy.

---

## Problem Statement

| Current Approach | Issue |
|:----------------|:------|
| Physical notice boards & posters | Limited reach, easily missed |
| Word-of-mouth announcements | Inconsistent and unreliable |
| Scattered social media posts | Fragmented, no coordination |
| No centralized calendar | Frequent scheduling conflicts |
| Manual attendance tracking | Inaccurate, time-consuming |
| No feedback mechanism | No way to improve event quality |
| Generic announcements | No personalization for guests |
| No graduation guest-pass workflow | Manual, error-prone distribution |

---

## System Architecture

CEMS follows a **Modular Monolith** architecture using NestJS — providing clean module boundaries (close to microservices) with the operational simplicity of a monolith. The ML service runs as a separate Python process.

## Key Features

###  Authentication & Authorization

- Secure registration with **email verification** (one-time token flow)
- JWT **access + refresh token** pair with session management
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Guest, Organizer, Admin
- Fine-grained **permission system** (per-role permission assignments)
- Password reset via time-limited email links
- **Brute-force protection** and rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Full **audit log** trail of all user and admin actions

###  Event Lifecycle Management

- Full event CRUD with rich metadata: title, description, venue, start/end time, capacity, type, categories, tags
- **Event types** and **categories** management by admins
- Administrative **approval workflow** for organizer-submitted events
- **Scheduling conflict detection** based on venue + time overlap
- **Event archiving** — archived events automatically trigger feedback email dispatch
- Event **media uploads** (posters, banners) via Cloudinary
- **Announcement broadcasts** to registered attendees

###  Event Discovery

- Centralized event listing with rich filtering (category, date, type, status)
- Keyword search across events
- **Bookmark system** — users can save events for later
- Role-aware browsing (guests see published events; organizers see their own; admins see all)
- Personalized **"For You"** feed powered by the ML recommendation engine

###  Registration & Attendance

- **RSVP system** with organizer approval workflow
- **QR code** generation for registered attendees
- QR code-based **check-in** at event entry
- Session-level attendance tracking (for multi-session events)
- **Waitlist** management with automatic promotion
- **Guest invite system** — organizers can invite external guests by email
- Dynamic **registration forms** with custom fields per event

###  Graduation Ceremony System

A specialized feature for managing the graduation ceremony:

- **CSV bulk import** of graduating guests (name, GPA, email)
- **Tiered guest-pass allocation** based on GPA (e.g., 3.75+ GPA → 3 passes, etc.)
- Per-guest **unique claim token** sent via email
- **Public claim portal** — graduating guests fill in guest details without login
- Guest pass delivery via **Email** or **Telegram** (QR code sent directly to Telegram)
- **Resend delivery** capability for failed or missed notifications
- PDF generation with QR codes for physical guest passes
- Admin can view the full guest roster and pass status per graduation event

###  Advanced Feedback System

A token-gated, structured post-event feedback system:

- **Automatic email dispatch** when an event is archived — sends a personalized JWT-secured feedback link to all confirmed attendees
- **Public feedback form** accessible without login via time-limited JWT token (14-day window)
- **Customizable feedback form templates** (Organizer/Admin):
  - Question types: `RATING`, `TEXT`, `SHORT_TEXT`, `MULTIPLE_CHOICE`, `SCALE`
  - Organizers create reusable templates and attach them to specific events
  - Falls back to a **built-in default template** if no custom template is assigned
- **Idempotent token handling** — safe to re-dispatch; already-submitted feedback is skipped
- **Role-separated response views**:
  - Admins: full respondent identity (name, email)
  - Organizers: semi-anonymous view (masked name & email)
- Paginated response listings for admin and organizer dashboards

###  Support Ticket System

A full-featured help desk with real-time chat:

- **Guest ticket creation** — unauthenticated users can open tickets (tracked by email)
- **Public ticket tracking** — guests can view their ticket status by ID + email
- Ticket categorization: `TECHNICAL`, `ACCOUNT`, `EVENT_ISSUE`, `EMERGENCY`, `OTHER`
- Priority levels: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `URGENT`
- Status workflow: `OPEN` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `RESOLVED` → `CLOSED`
- **Real-time WebSocket chat** (Socket.IO) between users/guests and admins
- Admin dashboard with ticket metrics (unresolved, in-progress, resolved, closed counts)
- Filterable data table by status, priority, and category
- **Target role routing** — tickets can be directed to specific admin roles

###  Notifications

- **Real-time in-app notifications** via WebSocket
- **Transactional emails** for:
  - Email verification
  - Password reset
  - Event registration confirmation
  - Feedback requests (post-event)
  - Graduation guest-pass claim links
  - Telegram guest pass delivery
- **BullMQ background queue** for reliable async email processing with retry logic

###  Analytics & Dashboards

- Admin overview: total events, users, registrations, attendance rates
- Per-event analytics: views, RSVPs, check-in counts, feedback scores
- **Activity feed** — real-time log of system events
- **Audit logs** — forensic trail of admin actions with before/after state, IP address, user agent
- Organizer dashboard: performance metrics for their events
- Charts and trend visualization on the main dashboard page

###  AI-Powered Recommendations

See the [AI Recommendation Engine](#ai-recommendation-engine) section below.

###  Theme & UI

- **Persistent light/dark mode** via Zustand + CSS variables
- Role-based **sidebar navigation** (Shadcn Sidebar) with context-aware collapsible groups:

## AI Recommendation Engine

The ML service (`apps/ml-service`) is a standalone **FastAPI** application implementing a **Hybrid Recommendation System**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph DataSources["Data Sources"]
        Prefs["User Preferences\n& Interests"]
        History["Attendance &\nRSVP History"]
        Interactions["Interactions\n(views, clicks, ratings)"]
    end

    subgraph Engine["Hybrid Recommendation Engine"]
        CBF["Content-Based Filtering\n• TF-IDF on event text\n• Cosine similarity\n• Category vectors"]
        SVD["Collaborative Filtering\n• SVD (scikit-surprise)\n• Latent factor model\n• Implicit feedback"]
        Ensemble["Weighted Ensemble\n+ Redis Cache"]
    end

    subgraph Output["Output"]
        Cold["Cold-Start Fallback\n(popular & category events)"]
        Results["Ranked Recommendations"]
    end

    Prefs --> CBF
    History --> SVD
    Interactions --> SVD
    Interactions --> CBF
    CBF --> Ensemble
    SVD --> Ensemble
    Ensemble --> Results
    Ensemble -- "New user detected" --> Cold
    Cold --> Results
```

**Key aspects:**
- **User interest vectors** from stated preferences, past attendance, and interactions
- **SVD collaborative filtering** discovers latent user-event relationships
- **Cold-start handling**: falls back to popular events and category defaults for new users
- **APScheduler** periodically retrains models in the background
- **Redis caching** for sub-100ms inference latency
- Evaluation metrics: Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K, Coverage

## Security Design

| Layer | Mechanism |
|:------|:----------|
| **Authentication** | JWT access/refresh tokens, Argon2 password hashing |
| **Authorization** | RBAC with fine-grained permissions enforced at route level |
| **Session Security** | Refresh token rotation, session revocation |
| **Data Transmission** | HTTPS/TLS via Nginx, CORS restricted to known origins |
| **Input Validation** | Global `ValidationPipe` (class-validator), whitelist-only, forbid unknown |
| **QR Check-in** | Signed tokens, tamper-resistant, replay detection |
| **Rate Limiting** | Brute-force protection on auth and sensitive endpoints |
| **Audit Trail** | All admin actions logged with IP, user agent, before/after state |
| **Secrets** | Environment variable injection, no secrets in source code |
| **Feedback Tokens** | SHA-256 hashed JWT, 14-day expiry, single-use enforced |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ (for local development outside Docker)

### 1. Clone & Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/Ministry-of-Innovation-MINT-event-Management-System.git
cd Ministry-of-Innovation-MINT-event-Management-System

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings (see Environment Variables section below)
```

### 2. Start All Services

```bash
# First run — builds all images
docker compose up --build

# Subsequent runs
docker compose up
```

This starts all 8 containers. Services are available at:

| Service | URL |
|:--------|:----|
| Web App | http://localhost |
| API | http://localhost/api |
| Swagger Docs | http://localhost/api/docs |
| ML Service | http://localhost:8000 |
| Maildev (email UI) | http://localhost:1080 |

### 3. Run Database Migrations

On first startup, migrations run automatically in the API container. To run manually:

```bash
docker compose exec api npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 4. Seed the Database

```bash
docker compose exec api npm run script_roles
docker compose exec api npm run script_users
docker compose exec api npm run script_events
```

### 5. Local Development (without Docker)

```bash
# Start only infrastructure services
docker compose up postgres redis maildev -d

# Run API locally
cd apps/api
npm install
npm run prisma:generate
npm run start:dev

# Run Web locally (in a separate terminal)
